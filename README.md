# Car_Rental_System
This C++ program is a basic car rental system that allows users to browse cars, select one for rental, input their details, and proceed with payment verification. 

Program Flow:
1.Login: The program starts by asking for a password ("pass"). Upon successful login, the user gains access to the car rental system.
2.Main Menu: After logging in, the user is presented with a list of car companies to choose from.
3.Details Display: Once a car company is chosen, detailed information about the car (model, color, max speed, etc.) is displayed.
4.Rental Process: Users are prompted to confirm if they want to rent the selected car. If confirmed, they enter their personal details and payment amount.
5.Payment Verification: The program verifies if the payment amount entered by the user meets or exceeds the car's rental price. If not, the user is prompted to enter the correct amount.
6.Continuation: After completing a rental, the user can choose to continue renting more cars or exit the system.
This program provides a basic framework for a car rental system.
